    <div id="history_text_body">
      <p>You may have heard accusations that the Grand Detectives Society is a “secret society”. Nothing could be further from the truth. And what’s the furthest thing from the truth? A lie. We cannot allow lies to propagate. It violates our strict code of ethics. It is for that reason we have chosen to disclose much of our history and dispel these spurious claims.</p>

      <p>The Society is simply a clandestine organization of like-minded, highly-skilled professionals who serve a common purpose: to bring the blinding light of truth to every dark corner of this Earth. Of course, when you trade in secrets, it is quite natural to keep a few of your own. That is simply the nature of the business, and it is an indelible piece of Society’s character. Some say our history stretches back to when the first man solved the first mystery. That would certainly be poetic, but it would not be accurate. The Society as we know it was formed by an assemblage of nameless detectives in the year 1804, in a most curious location: deep within the Parisian catacombs. The catalyst for our creation came through the hand of the Emperor himself: Napoleon I. Napoleonic rule had recently abolished the traditional Detectives Guilds of Europe, forcing the men underground, to continue their work in secret or be destroyed. In persecution they became united. In shadow they became skilled. In time, they became the Grand Detectives Society.</p>

      <p>The Society did not remain a secret for long. The veil of oppression lifted, and the following century became known as the Golden Age of Detectives. Society members made headlines all over the world. Mysteries of all kinds were being solved, from foulest murder to fairest legend. For generations, the Society was at the forefront of social discourse, lauded for achievement after achievement. Those generations have come and gone. The public eye has turned away once more, but the legacy remains and our future is brighter than ever. A new age has begun, ushered in by our visionary leader, Dorian Cubsbane. The greatest mysteries of the world will once more be revealed, and the greatest detectives will rise to face them.</p>
