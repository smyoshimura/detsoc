      <p>The Grand Detectives Society Escape Rooms are real-life interactive games and fully immersive experiences. You and your chosen team will be locked inside a themed room with 60 minutes to escape and solve the mystery unique to that scenario. Find clues, solve puzzles, uncover dark, soul-defiling secrets, but above all else, ensure your survival. You are the detective, and the greatest mysteries are yours to solve.</p>

        <div class="header2">What to Expect</div>

        <p>A complete escape room experience will require 90 minutes from start to finish. The first thirty minutes of every visit will be guided by one of our curators, who will give you a brief tour and history of the Society, and provide necessary context for your experience. Escaping the room is only one piece of the puzzle: each room features a mystery that demands to be solved. You will receive a debriefing and casefile containing all pertinent details, and trials to ensure you are prepared. From there you will enter the room, the door will be locked and you will have 60 minutes to escape. When the game has ended and your survival has been assured, your group will propose a solution to the mystery and bear witness the truth first hand.</p>

        <div class="header2">Booking Your Experience</div>

        <p>All bookings must be scheduled online through the Detectives Society website. On the booking page, select the room you wish to book and an available time slot. You may reserve spaces as a group or as an individual. If you would like the room to yourself, you may purchase additional slots, otherwise additional guests may join your game. Please take into account the recommended number of players listed for the individual rooms. Some games may prove too difficult for low numbers of players.</p>

        <div class="header2">The Prize</div>

        <p>A mystery solved is its own reward, yet many have heard talk of a “prize”. The talk is true. This is not mere entertainment. So what is this prize, you ask? Is the prize glory? Oh, there will be glory, make no mistake. Glory enough for all. But glory alone is not the prize. Is the prize gold? Heavens no. How could gold ever compare to the incalculable worth of a single brilliant deduction? It cannot. In fact, there is only one reward greater than a mystery solved: preliminary membership in the Grand Detectives Society. Prove your intellectual worth and the path may be open to you. Should the time come, your curator will instruct you further.</p>

  <div id="history">
    <div class="header" id="">A BRIEF HISTORY <span id="history_logo"></span> OF THE SOCIETY</div>

    <p>You may have heard accusations that the Grand Detectives Society is a “secret society”. Nothing could be further from the truth. And what’s the furthest thing from the truth? A lie. We cannot allow lies to propagate. It violates our strict code of ethics. It is for that reason we have chosen to disclose much of our history and dispel these spurious claims.</p>

    <p>The Society is simply a clandestine organization of like-minded, highly-skilled professionals who serve a common purpose: to bring the blinding light of truth to every dark corner of this Earth. Of course, when you trade in secrets, it is quite natural to keep a few of your own. That is simply the nature of the business, and it is an indelible piece of Society’s character. Some say our history stretches back to when the first man solved the first mystery. That would certainly be poetic, but it would not be accurate. The Society as we know it was formed by an assemblage of nameless detectives in the year 1804, in a most curious location: deep within the Parisian catacombs. The catalyst for our creation came through the hand of the Emperor himself: Napoleon I. Napoleonic rule had recently abolished the traditional Detectives Guilds of Europe, forcing the men underground, to continue their work in secret or be destroyed. In persecution they became united. In shadow they became skilled. In time, they became the Grand Detectives Society.</p>

    <p>The Society did not remain a secret for long. The veil of oppression lifted, and the following century became known as the Golden Age of Detectives. Society members made headlines all over the world. Mysteries of all kinds were being solved, from foulest murder to fairest legend. For generations, the Society was at the forefront of social discourse, lauded for achievement after achievement. Those generations have come and gone. The public eye has turned away once more, but the legacy remains and our future is brighter than ever. A new age has begun, ushered in by our visionary leader, Dorian Cubsbane. The greatest mysteries of the world will once more be revealed, and the greatest detectives will rise to face them.</p>
